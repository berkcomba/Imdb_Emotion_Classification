Imdb Dataset Emotion Classification

Just for practice...

# Be careful... There might be overfitting.
-Accuracy in 20 epochs = 0.8639

-Accuracy in 4  epochs = 0.8840


# Accuracy of the system changes by number of hidden layers,
-with one hidden layer    (Fully Connected / relu) = 0.8837

-with two hidden layers   (Fully Connected / relu) = 0.8840

-with three hidden layers (Fully Connected / relu) = 0.8874
